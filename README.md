# SOXInteractiveBoundedImageView
An image which responds to pan, pinch and rotation, which auto bounds itself to its superview.

**NOTE:**

Subclass of <a href="https://github.com/spagosx/Swift-Pan-Rotate-Zoom-ImageView">SOXPanRotateZoomImageView</a>

**Looking at the screen below:**

Both images are subviews of the blue view, the free view can go outside the blue view bounds; the bounded one can't.
